# Samsara-Test
Samsara Test is a test assignment I recently did for a company called Samsara. 

This project has GPS Log files and I did an analysis to find which GPS were bad and had to be disposed which need to be retested and ones that are still good.

There are 3 important files and folders -
1. Data Folder - Contains all data - There are 6 folders 1 train and 5 test folders where defective number of GPS are only 16.
2. Code file - Contains the jupyter notebook file you can see it to check all the steps for analysis <br><br>
2.1 Extracting data to a dataframe <br>
2.2 Running various visualizations <br>
2.3 Running a small survey with SMOTE<br>
2.4 Making predictions<br>
2.5 Deciding manually based on probability histogram which need to be sent back for retesting.

3. Visualization folder - Contains 2 Tableau Visualization - 1. is using bigquery and 2 is using csv files which doesn't have a full story.
